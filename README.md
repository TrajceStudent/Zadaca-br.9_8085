# Zadaca-br.9_8085

8085 based microprocessor system serves for temperature control. The control is performed every 0.5 s. If the temperature read is in the interval between two boundary temperatures, located at the top of the stack, are lights up a green light bulb, and vice versa, a red light bulb lights up and the processor stops working. The temperature comes after interrupt sequence.

**Built With**

This project is built using the following tools:

- [Emu8086](https://emu8086-microprocessor-emulator.en.softonic.com/): Assembler and emulator for the Intel 8086 microprocessor.

**Getting Started**

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

**Prerequisites**

In order to run this project you need:

A working computer
Connection to internet
Setup

**How to Run**

To run the program, you need an 8086 emulator or assembler. You can use emulators like DOSBox or TASM (Turbo Assembler). Here's how to run the program using EMU8086:

1. Download and install Emu8086 from [here](https://emu8086-microprocessor-emulator.en.softonic.com/).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open Emu8086 and load the `palindrome.asm` file.
4. Assemble the code by pressing the Assemble button.
5. Run the program by pressing the Run button or by pressing F10.
